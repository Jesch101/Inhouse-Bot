# Inhouse-Bot
A discord bot that can be used to run game nights!

Note: token value was deleted as it is an unique string used to get access to running the bot.

Users can use /queue and /begin to easily run game nights on discord! The bot automatically creates a list of those participating and those watching and randomly sorts and 
moves them to specified voice channels! This bot was made for a specific server, hence the hard coded roles that are allowed to use and operate the bot.
